The Klout Raplet (f.k.a. Kloutlet) is a plugin for Rapportive that brings Klout scores into Gmail. View the sender's Klout score right in Gmail!

Though not an official Klout product, they have approved of it. 

Rapportive backs the product and even listed it on their official Raplet directory (https://rapportive.com/raplets).

In 2010 Shoutlet asked us to rename to avoid confusion.
